Given a grid of size m * n, let us assume you are starting at (1, 1) and your goal is to reach (m, n). At any
instance, if you are on (x, y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and empty space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Input: The first line of input contains 2 numbers n,m, denoting size of the grid. Next n lines contains m space separated integers.

Output: Print a single integer denoting the maximum number of Gajas in the army.

Your Task : Complete the function ways that returns a single integer denoting the number of unique paths.

Constraints:
1<=N,M<=100
0<=A[i][j]<=1

Example:
Input:
3 3
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0

Output:
2

Explanation:
There is only one obstacle in the middle.
