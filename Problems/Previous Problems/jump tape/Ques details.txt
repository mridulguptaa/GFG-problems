Mridul is playing a game.He is on the x-axis , standing at the position 0 in the beginning.

There are n cards, each card has 2 attributes: length li and cost ci. If he pays ci Rupees then he can apply i-th card. After applying i-th card he becomes able to make jumps of length li, i. e. from position x to position (x?-?li) or position (x?+?li).

He wants to be able to jump to any position on the axis(possibly, visiting some intermediate cells). For achieving this goal, he wants to buy some cards, paying as little money as possible.

If this is possible, calculate the minimal cost.

Input: 

The first line contains an integer n , number of cards.
The second line contains n numbers li , the jump lengths of cards.
The third line contains n numbers ci , the costs of cards.

Output:

If it is impossible to buy some cards and become able to jump to any cell, output -1. Otherwise output the minimal cost of buying such set of cards.

Constraints:
1?=?n?=?300
1?=?li?=?109
1?=?ci?=?105

Example :
Input: 
3
100 99 9900
1 1 1

Output:
2

Input: 
5
10 20 30 40 50
1 1 1 1 1

Output:
-1

Explanation : 
In first sample test, buying one card is not enough: for example, if you buy a card with length 100, you can't jump to any cell whose index is not a multiple of 100. The best way is to buy first and second card, that will make you be able to jump to any cell.

In the second sample test, even if you buy all cards, you can't jump to any cell whose index is not a multiple of 10, so you should output -1.
