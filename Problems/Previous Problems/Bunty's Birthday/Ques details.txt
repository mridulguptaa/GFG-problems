Today is Bunty's Birthday. Bunty has N friends , i-th friend(0 -based indexing) have a positive strength s[i]. His friends have decided to give Bunty Birthday bombs. Bunty’s friends know Bunty’s pain bearing limit and would hit accordingly. If Bunty’s resistance is denoted by A ,then find the lexicographically smallest order of friends to punch Bunty so that the cumulative punch strength (sum of the strengths of friends who punches) doesn’t exceed his resistance capacity and total no. of punches hit are maximum.
Note: A friend a punch as many times as he wants.

Return the lexicographically smallest sequence of maximum length where the ith index represents the index of the friend who will hit.

Input: The first line will contain N,the number of friends and A, Bunty's resistance. Next line contains N space-separated integers denoting strength of friends.

Output: Print the required sequence .

Your Task : Complete the function solve that returns a vector containing desired sequence.

Constraints:
1<=N<=1e5
1<=s[i]<=1e9
1<=A<=1e7

Example:
Input:
2 10
4 3

Output:
1 2 2

Input:
3 50
50 100 100

Output:
1

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Friend1 can hit 1 time and Friend 2 can hit 2 times.
Test Case 2 : Only Friend1 can hit only once.
