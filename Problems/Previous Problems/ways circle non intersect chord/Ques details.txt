Given a number N, find the number of ways you can draw N chords in a circle with 2*N points such that no 2 chords intersect.
Two ways are different if there exists a chord which is present in one way and not in other

Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each testcase, there will be only 1 line that contains N.

Output: Corresponding to each test case, print number of ways you can draw N chords in a circle with 2*N points such that no 2 chords intersect. Since the number of ways can be too large, print answer % 1000000007.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100000

Example:
Input:
2
2
1

Output:
2
1

Explanation:
TestCase 1: 
If points are numbered 1 to 4 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are:
{(1-2), (3-4)} and {(1-4), (2-3)}.

TestCase 2:
Draw a chord between points 1 and 2.
