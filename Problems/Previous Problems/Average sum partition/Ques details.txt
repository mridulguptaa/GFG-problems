Given a set of n strings arr[], find the smallest string that contains each string in the given set as substring.We may assume that no string in arr[] is substring of another string.

Input: The first line contains a n, the number of strings in the set. Next n lines contain a string each.

Output: Print the length of of smallest superstring of the given set of strings.

Your Task : Complete the function findShortestSuperstring() arrange that returns the minimum length.

Constraints:
1<=n<=10
1<=strlen(A[i])<=50

Example:
Input:
4
abcd
cdef
fgh
dp

Output:
10

Explanation:
Shortest string: "abcdefghdp"
