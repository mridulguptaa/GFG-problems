Given an array of size N. The task is to partition the given array into two subsets such that the average of all the elements in both subsets is equal. If no such partition exists print -1. Otherwise, print the partitions. If multiple solutions exist, print the solution where the length of the first subset is minimum. If there is still a tie then print the partitions where the first subset is lexicographically smallest.

Input: The first line contains a T, the number of test cases followed by n, the number of elements in the array. Next line contains n space-separated integers.

Output: Print 2 required sets of integers. If no solution exits, print -1.

Constraints:
1<=n<=10
1<=T<=10
Note : Sum of all elements of array won't exceed 1000.

Example:
Input:
6
1 7 15 11 29 9

Output:
[9,15] ,[1,7,11,29]

Input:
3
5 5 6

Output:
-1

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Average of both subsets is 12.
Test Case 2 : Average can't be same.
