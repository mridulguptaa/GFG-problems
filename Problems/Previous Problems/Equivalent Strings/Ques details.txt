Two strings a and b of equal length are called Equivalent in one of the two cases:

They are equal.
If we split string a into two halves of the same size a 1 and a 2, and string b into two halves of the same size b 1 and b 2, then one of the following is correct:
a 1 is equivalent to b 1, and a 2 is equivalent to b 2
a 1 is equivalent to b 2, and a 2 is equivalent to b 1
Check if the given two strings are Equivalent.

Input: First and the only line inputs two strings.

Ouput: If the two strings are Equivalent, Print YES else Print NO.

Your Task: Complete the function check() that receives two strings as parameters and prints YES or NO.

Example:
Input:
aaba
abaa
Output:
YES

Input:
aabb
abab
Output:
NO

Explanation:
In the first sample you should split the first string into strings "aa" and "ba", the second one—into strings "ab" and "aa". "aa" is equivalent to "aa"; "ab" is equivalent to "ba" as "ab" = "a" + "b", "ba" = "b" + "a".
In the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings "aa" and "bb", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string "aabb" is equivalent only to itself and to string "bbaa".Two strings a and b of equal length are called Equivalent in one of the two cases:
