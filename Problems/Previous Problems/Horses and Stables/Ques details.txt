You are given a sequence S of black and white horses, and a set of K stables numbered 1 to K. You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:

You fill the horses into the stables preserving the relative order of horses. For instance, you cannot put horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1. You have to preserve the ordering of the horses.
No stable should be empty and no horse should be left unaccommodated.
Take the product (number of whiteHorses*number of BlackHorses) for each stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum among all possible accommodation arrangements
Input: The first line contains a string (the sequence of horses) followed by an integer K (number of stables).

Output: Print the minimum sum of product. If no solution is possible, print -1.

Your Task : Complete the function arrange that returns the answer.

Constraints:
1<=strlen(S)<=500
1<=K<=500

Example:
Input:
WWWB 2

Output:
0

Explanation:
We have 3 choices {W, WWB}, {WW, WB}, {WWW, B}.
For first choice we will get 1*0 + 2*1 = 2.
For second choice we will get 2*0 + 1*1 = 1.
For third choice we will get 3*0 + 0*1 = 0.
