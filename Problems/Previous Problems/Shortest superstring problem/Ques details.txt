Given a set of n strings , find the smallest string that contains each string in the given set as substring. We may assume that no string in the given set is substring of another string.

Input: The first line contains a n, the number of strings in the set. Next n lines contain a string each.

Output: Print the length of of smallest superstring of the given set of strings.

Your Task : Complete the function findShortestSuperstring() arrange that returns the minimum length.

Constraints:
1<=n<=10
1<=strlen(A[i])<=50

Example:
Input:
4
abcd
cdef
fgh
dp
Output:
10

Input:
3
a
b
c

Output:
3

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Shortest string is "abcdefghdp".
Test Case 2 : Shortest string is "abc".
