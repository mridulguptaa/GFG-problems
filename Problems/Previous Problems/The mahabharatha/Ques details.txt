The battle between Pandavas and kauravas is about to begin in a week. Dhritarashtra, the king of Kauravas is a bit worried about his army. He wants to have maximum number of Gaja(soldier on an elephant) to increase the chances of his victory.
Each Gaja needs a mahout who would ride the elephant for him. Each mahout has a skill level ski and each elephant has an aggressiveness of agj. A mahout can control and ride an elephant if and only if his skills are atleast double the aggressiveness of his elephant.
