Given a vector of positive elements, you have to flip the sign of some of its elements such that the resultant sum of the elements of vector should be minimum non-negative (as close to zero as possible). Return the minimum no. of elements whose sign needs to be flipped such that the resultant sum is minimum non-negative. Note that the sum of all the array elements will not exceed 104.

Input: The first line contains n, the number of elements in the vector followed by n space separated integers.

Output: Print the minimum number of flips required in order to get minimum non-negative sum.

Constraint:
1<=n<=1000
1<=abs(A[i])<=1000
0<=abs(sum)<=10000

Your Task: Complete the fuction min_flips that receives a vector of integers.

Example:
Input:
3
15 10 6
Output:
1

Input:
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
2
Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Here we will flip the sign of 15 to get resultant sum 1.
Test Case 2 : Here we will flip the sign of 2 and 3 to get resultant sum 0.
