Given a 3 X n board, find the number of ways to color it using at most 4 colors such that no two adjacent boxes have the same color. Diagonal neighbors are not treated as adjacent boxes.
Output the ways%1000000007 as the answer grows quickly.

Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each testcase, there will be only 1 line denoting the length of the matrix. 

Output: Corresponding to each test case, print the Product of all subarrays of the array in a new line.

Your Task : Complete the all_subarray_product function that takes array and n and returns Product of all subarrays of the array.
Constraints:

1<=T<=100

1<=N<=1000

1<=arr[i]<=10
Example:

Input:

2

10 3 7

2

2 4

Output:

30870

64

Explanation:

TestCase 1 :  Here, subarrays are [10], [10, 3], [10, 3, 7], [3], [3, 7], [7]. Prodcuts are 10, 30, 210, 3, 21 and 7 . Product of all Subarrays = 30870.

TestCase 2: Here, subarrays are [2], [2, 4], [4]. Prodcuts are 2, 8, 4. Product of all Subarrays = 64.
