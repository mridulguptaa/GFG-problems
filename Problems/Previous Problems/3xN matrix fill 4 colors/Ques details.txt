Given a 3 X n board, find the number of ways to color it using at most 4 colors such that no two adjacent boxes have the same color. Diagonal neighbors are not treated as adjacent boxes. Output the ways%1000000007 as the answer grows quickly.

Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. For each testcase, there will be only 1 line denoting the length of the matrix. 

Output: Corresponding to each test case, print the Product of all subarrays of the array in a new line.

Your Task : Complete the ways function that takes  n and returns Product of all subarrays of the array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100000

Example:

Input:
2

Output:

Explanation:
TestCase 1 :

We can use either a combination of 3 colors
or 2 colors. Now, choosing 3 colors out of 
4 is  and arranging them 
in 3! ways, similarly choosing 2 colors out 
of 4 is  and while arranging
we can only choose which of them could be at 
centre, that would be 2 ways. 
Answer = *3! + *2! = 36
