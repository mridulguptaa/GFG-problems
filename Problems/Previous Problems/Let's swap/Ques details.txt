You are given a string, S, and a list of words in Dictionary , that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in Dictionary exactly once and without any intervening characters. All words in dictionary are of same length.

Input: The first line contains a T, the number of test cases followed by n, the number of strings in the dictionary. Next line contains n space-separated strings. Next line contains the string S.

Output: Print the desired vector of integers.

Constraints:
1<=n<=50
1<=T<=10
Note : Sum of all elements of array won't exceed 1000.
