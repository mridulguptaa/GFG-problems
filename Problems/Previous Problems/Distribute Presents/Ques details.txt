There are N girls of equal height standing in a queue. A girl can see another girl standing just besides her. Each girl is given a present - a dress to wear. There are K types of dresses. A girl cannot tolerate if she has a dress of same kind as that of the girl on the left AND the girl on the right and thus tears the dress. You have infinite supply of each type of dress. Find in how many ways you can give the present to N girls.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers N and K.

Output:
Print an integer which denoted the number of ways in which the presents can be distributed.(modulo 109 + 7)

Your Task : 
Complete the function countWays that returns the answer.

Constraints:
1<=T<=1000
1<=N<=100000
1<=K<=100

Example:
Input:
